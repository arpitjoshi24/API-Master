# 🧪 PostmanClone – Offline API Testing Tool

## 📚 Overview

Welcome to the **Postman Clone** project! This repository documents the development of a lightweight, offline-friendly API testing tool built using **React** and **Express**. It allows users to test RESTful APIs, manage requests, and view responses — all in a smooth, intuitive interface.

Our goal is to create a simplified version of Postman that can work offline and be extended with advanced features like automated test assertions, token-based authentication, and customizable request options.

---

## 🔍 Project Goals

- **Request Builder**: Allow users to make various HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
- **Header & Body Support**: Include customizable headers and JSON payloads.
- **Auth Handling**: Add bearer tokens or custom headers for secure endpoints.
- **Test Tab**: Evaluate response data against expected results.
- **Offline Friendly**: Optionally run as a desktop app using Electron.
- **Frontend-Backend Isolation**: React for UI, Express for backend simulations.

## 🧠 Core Modules

### React (Frontend)
- Dynamic input fields for headers, parameters, and body
- Request/Response display panels
- Test tab with custom assertions
- JSON formatting and pretty printing

### Express (Backend)
- Dummy API endpoints for testing
- Middleware for logging and CORS
- Token-based authentication example routes

---

## ✅ Advantages

- Offline testing capability (with Electron)
- No need for third-party tools
- Minimal system requirements
- Highly extensible and beginner-friendly

## ❌ Limitations

- Manual data entry for request setup
- Requires knowledge of HTTP/JSON basics
- Currently supports only basic assertions
- Not a replacement for full-featured tools like Postman (yet)

---

## 📋 Applications

This clone can be used for:

- API Development and Testing
- Learning HTTP request/response cycles
- Teaching RESTful APIs to students
- Simulating server-client interaction offline

---

## 📊 Features in Action

### Request Builder
- Select method (GET/POST/etc)
- Enter URL and headers
- Write JSON body

### Test Tab
- Add test cases like: `Status = 200`, `response.body.success == true`

### Response Panel
- Shows status, time, size, and JSON response

## ⚙️ Fitness-Like Function (Test Tab Logic)

While not a genetic algorithm, the **Test Tab** includes a logic engine to simulate assertions:

- **Validations**
  - Status code match
  - Presence of keys
  - Value checks (equal, contains, etc.)

Each passed test adds to the visual "score" of a request success rate. This encourages building better APIs.
